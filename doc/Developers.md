# Developer Guide
After you have read ```doc/Details.md``` you should have enough knowledge to write
your own plugin if you study the existing ones.

A detailed documentation will be available after the 1.0 release. Plugin system
is considered stable, so you can start working on some extras. I would be happy
to include them.

Make sure to send a pull request and license them under something that is
compatible with Zenbos BSD license.
