# Zenbo
Zenbo is a static site generation framework. You save your page as plain / text, run Zenbo and a few minutes later you have your complete site ready to be deployed.

I am currently deploying my first site with Zenbo but it is under heavy development. The directory structure and core features will not change so you can use it for your own site but I suggest you keep your Zenbo installation up to date.

## Features
Since Zenbo is under heavy development I have only released core features so far.
