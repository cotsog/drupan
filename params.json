{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"This is an alpha release. It should be stable and work as expected but it is\r\nnot yet feature complete. Documentation still sucks but you should be able to\r\nfigure it out with the quick start section below.\r\n\r\n# Zenbo - static site generator\r\nZenbo is a static site generator. You can use it for blogs, sites or anything\r\nyou can imagine. Adding new features is easy thanks to a easy to use plugin\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\nCopy ```doc/example``` to another location, run ```python path/to/zenbo.py\r\npath/to/example --no-deploy --serve``` and point your browser to ```http://localhost:9000```.\r\n\r\nTo create additional pages or posts you can find a template for each of them\r\nin ```example/draft/```.\r\n\r\nFor further details please read ```doc/Details.md```. It should cover everything\r\nyou need to know to get a site up and running using Zenbo.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n  - Markdown support\r\n  - Handling images\r\n  - Deploy with git\r\n  - Generate archives and RSS Feeds\r\n  - easily extend it using plugins\r\n  - minimal external dependencies (currently only PyYAML in default distribution)\r\n\r\nWe use Jinja as template system and you can access everything Zenbo considers\r\nContent in every template. So your imagination is the limit of your site. (Well\r\nbeside some technical stuff)\r\n\r\n## BETA\r\nZenbo is considered beta. It \"powers\" sites that are already used in \"production\".\r\nStill there could be some bugs. It is tested against Python 2.7, likely not \r\ncompatible to 3.x (see ```finalizers/imagecopy.py```)\r\n","name":"Zenbo","google":"","tagline":"Zenbo is a static site generation tool"}
